### Overview
Masked Autoencoders are self-supervised learners for computer vision which can generate representations of data in a scalable way.

### Approach
They start by masking random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels.

Consists of encoder-decoder architechture as follows:
1. **Encoder**: Operates on visible patches in the image
2. **Decoder**: Lightweight decoder that reconstructs original image from masked tokens and representation generated from encoder.

They mask a high proportion of the input image i.e. 75% which leads to a self-supervisory task. The model learns to generate the masked patches from the visible patches.
